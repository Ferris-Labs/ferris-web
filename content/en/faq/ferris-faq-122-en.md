<!-- ANSWER -->

The different service types can be used along their integration depths via different interfaces.Basically, all functionalities of the core platform are available both via a web interfave and a rest of the gateway.In addition, messaging / event queues and webhooks are possible as further interaction level.In the case of fully encapsulated artifacts such as dedicated API servers, consumer or producer containers or event-stripped container instances, it is also possible that further case-specific UIS and APIs are instantiated.
