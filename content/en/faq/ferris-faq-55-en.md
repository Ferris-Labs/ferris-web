{{< faq question="Does Ferris have the ability that two processes/applications can communicate with each other without having to be synchronized (e.g. via queues)?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

Yes, this ability is possible on both script and code-based species facts as well as on the basis of coherent event chains.A bridging of synchronous asynchronous and asynchronous synchronous fracture is possible.

Different monitoring and time-out patterns and different priotity lanes can be configured and used fairly.
