<!-- ANSWER -->

Various additional services can be combined sensibly with an IOP project to harden the overall system:
1) Connection of external security screening & monitoring systems
2) Automation of Joiner/Mover/Leaver Processes
3) Integration of the Data Governance / Data Quality Toolset
4) Initialization of a policy as code program (e.G. Open Policy Agent)
