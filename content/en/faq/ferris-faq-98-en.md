<!-- ANSWER -->

The platform is designed in such a way that a project and entity-compliant sandbox can be offered.

The Sandbox platform is therefore very suitable as a research, pilot or POC environment to test new technologies, services or third -party providers.

The sandbox can be completely self -sufficient, or only partially, by the main environment.

However, the IAM authorization system can be used to manage the Sanbox and its users.
