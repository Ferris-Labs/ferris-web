<!-- ANSWER -->

The integration platform offers extensive functions for testing interfaces, including functional interface tests, safety tests and load and performance tests.

Functional interface tests:
The platform enables the implementation of functional cutting tests to ensure that interfaces work according to the defined requirements and specifications.Developers can create and carry out test cases to check the correct integration and interaction between different components.

Safety tests for interfaces:
The platform integrates safety tests for interfaces to identify potential weaknesses and security risks.This includes checking data encryption, authentication, authorization and other safety -relevant aspects.These tests help to ensure the integrity and safety of the interfaces.

Load and performance tests for interfaces:
The platform enables load and performance tests to evaluate the reaction and performance of interfaces under different load conditions.Developers can create scripts to simulate the effects of simultaneous inquiries, amounts of data and other load scenarios.This helps to identify bottlenecks and performance problems at an early stage.
