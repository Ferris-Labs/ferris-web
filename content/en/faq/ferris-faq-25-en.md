<!-- ANSWER -->

Integration testing in the integration platform focuses on ensuring the seamless cooperation between various elements, services and data sources.The platform not only offers development and automation options for these processes, but also comprehensive functions for testing integration processes.A central aspect is the possibility of isolating individual integrative elements and performing both isolated and end-to-end tests.This can be done in test environments and in environments for user Acceptance testing (UAT), both with synthetic test data and with production -related data.

Main features of the integration test in the platform:

Comprehensive integration tests:
The platform enables integrations to be extensively tested across various data sources, systems and services.This ensures that all components are effectively communicating with each other and smoothly integrated.

Development and test environments:
Integration tests can be carried out in dedicated development and test environments.This enables tests to be carried out in a controlled environment before changes in production environments are implemented.The dedicated guidance of parameters, configurations and other environmental variables without manual interventions on source code or deployments and thus zero devops testing.

Isolated tests from integration components:
A central feature is the possibility of isolating individual integrative elements and carrying out specific tests.This facilitates the troubleshooting and understanding of causes with problems occurring.

End-to-end tests:
The possibility of carrying out end-to-end tests can be checked by the overall functionality of the integration platform.This ensures that all elements involved work correctly in order to meet the expected overall results.

Synthetic test data:
The platform supports the use of synthetic test data in order to simulate different scenarios and outskirts.This enables the integration processes to be tested under different conditions.

Production -related data in the test environment:
In addition to synthetic test data, production -related data can also be used in the test environments.This ensures that tests are carried out under conditions that come close to those of the production environment.
