The Platfform can be expanded at any time with additional nodes (CPU, RAM).An interruption in the company is not necessary.

High scalability with millions of messages per minute:
The platform is highly scalable and can process millions of messages per minute.This enables efficient processing of large amounts of data and ensures a quick execution of executions and services.

Horizontal clustering from Executions:
Executions are clustered horizontally to ensure scalability.This method enables dynamic adjustment during the term without affecting operational operation.

Unimagined operation during run-time scaling:
The platform enables the scaling of executions during operation without disturbing operational operation.This ensures a continuous execution of jobs, even during scaling.
