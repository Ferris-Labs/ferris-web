<!-- ANSWER -->

Data flows such as inhabit and cursions are modeled, implemented and executed as an event controlled event cascades.

Each individual data flow (cascade) consists of individual services and events that can be combined and reused as desired.

The so -called Correlation ID ensures continuous transparency and persecution in all directions (upstream, downstream).
