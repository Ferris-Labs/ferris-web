<!-- ANSWER -->

We often assume a hybrid-agile project approach, in which all planning and design work is organized in advance and centrally.The infrastructure is provided by the UsZ processes and employees.The implementation of the relevant basic skills and the USZ-specific integration aspects then take place in an agile approach with 2- or 3-week sprints and an easier form of affiliation meetings (aka "ceremonies"), which are the administrative effort of all those involvedto reduce.In any case, employees and remote employees are to be used in line with needs, i.e. along the usual way of working along the usual way of working.
