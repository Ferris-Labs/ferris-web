{{< faq question="How do you treat topics such as: Fault Tolerance, Redundancy, Disaster Recovery?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

The platform allows for granular, individual and prioritized repeat attempts from failed jobs, services and executions.

The combined Kubernetes and Kafka solution demonstrates a number of robust properties to ensure reliability and resistance to errors.

Fault Tolerance (error resistance):
The solution integrates mechanisms for resistance to errors at different levels.This includes the ability to react to failures of individual components or nodes without affecting the entire company.For example, Kafka offers replication mechanisms to prevent data loss in the event of failures.

Redundancy:
Redundance mechanisms are implemented in the solution to ensure that critical components and data are provided in redundant.For example, Kubernetes enables the scaling of pods and the distribution of applications via several cluster nodes to ensure reliability.

Disaster Recovery:
The solution offers strategies for restoring after disasters in order to resume operation even after serious disorders.This includes the possibility of restoring data from secure back-ups and continuing the operation at an alternative location.

Automated recovery:
Automated recovery mechanisms are implemented in order to react automatically to recognized errors.This includes the promotion of services and resources in order to restore normal operation as soon as possible.

Monitoring and alarm:
In order to ensure robustness, extensive surveillance and alarm functions are integrated.These enable the continuous monitoring of the system state and notifying administrators with potential problems.

Security mechanisms:
The solution includes security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and protect the integrity of the data.This helps to ward off potential attacks and maintain the reliability of the system.
