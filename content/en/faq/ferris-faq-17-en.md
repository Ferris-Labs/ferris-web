<!-- QUESTION -->

{{< faq question="Does the platform offer to import and export data flows from Leanix?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

Yes, the Leanix API can be integrated and used for both sides of synchronization.Which specific endpoints and services are used in which context should be considered using real examples.In the past, usage data for services, APIs and containers / message volume were handed over to Leanix for the aggregation of metrics.

Technically, we also support all leanix variants for this integration - rest, graphql and webhooks for all inbound & outbound processors.

Use of the existing API / JSON PAYLoad schemas as standards Message / Event Standards and corresponding use in manual, event-stripped and time-controlled processes / event chains.
