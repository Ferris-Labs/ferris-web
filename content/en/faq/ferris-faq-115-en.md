{{< faq question="What mechanisms does the platform offer to implement high availability?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

With regard to high availability, the platform demonstrates extremely high performance:

Millions of executions and services daily:
The platform copes with a high load by performing millions of executions and services every day.This enables broad applicability for extensive workload scenarios.

Event-driven architecture with Kafka:
The platform uses an event-driven architecture based on Kafka.This enables seamless streams of events, which means that the platform Agil can react to changes and real -time events.

High scalability with millions of messages per minute:
The platform is highly scalable and can process millions of messages per minute.This enables efficient processing of large amounts of data and ensures a quick execution of executions and services.

Horizontal clustering from Executions:
Executions are clustered horizontally to ensure scalability.This method enables dynamic adjustment during the term without affecting operational operation.

Unimagined operation during run-time scaling:
The platform enables the scaling of executions during operation without disturbing operational operation.This ensures a continuous execution of jobs, even during scaling.

Low impairment of neighboring platform components:
Run-time jobs do not disturb neighboring platform components such as databases.This ensures stable and reliable operation, even if intensive jobs are carried out.

Kafka for scalable input and output data:
The platform relies on Kafka to stream most operational input and output data.This ensures the highest possible scalability and speed when processing data.

Easy scaling by adding replicas:
The platform is easily scaled by adding additional replicas to the existing clusters.This flexible scalability enables efficient adaptation to increasing requirements.
