<!-- QUESTION -->

{{< faq question="Does Ferris support a publish and subscribe pattern for news transmission for producers and consumers?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

Both specially developed and prefabricated cosumers can subscribe to messages that can either be channel-specific (topic), event-specific (status / event type) or Payoad-specific (message content).In return, producers can define patterns for subscriptions and restrict or limit them fairly for their respective use case.
