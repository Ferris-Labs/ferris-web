<!-- ANSWER -->

Major (serious and exploited) platform weak spots are analyzed promptly with the support of the responsible specialist areas using the Major Vulnerability process and on the basis of our ongoing internal and external security intelligence., a risk assessment and a recommendation (e.g. Emergency patching or risk mitigation using a manufacturer workaround)submitted to our account representatives and customer contacts.Control options offer our internal security & compliance Check Tools & Platforms, which quickly enable us to identify systems or system components (from platform to OS to Middleware, database and application layer).to be carried out in a targeted and sustainable manner.
