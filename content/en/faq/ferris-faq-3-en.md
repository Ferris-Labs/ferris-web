Ferris FX platform: Detailed overview of the feature extensions

The FX platform faces a number of transformative extensions that introduce advanced functions to improve its skills in event management, orchestration of projects, AI-controlled development, data integrity and configuration management.These feature extensions are carefully designed in order to strengthen the infrastructure of the platform, optimize processes and to provide first-class solutions for complex corporate requirements.

1. Event domains
Event domains redefine the event-controlled architecture of the platform by introducing the concept of configurable visibility and access controls for events within 'projects' (collections of related services).This function improves data security and the autonomy of the services by enabling services within a project to control which other services can 'see' or access it.It offers a standard data protection setting and enables configurable options for wider visibility or restricted access via keys.Configuration management is designed to easily configure these settings.

2. GIT-based project and user management
GIT-based and S3-based project and user management integrates project facilities and user authorizations directly with GIT repositories and thus ensures a coherent, version-controlled environment.This function improves traceability and efficiency by making it possible to define project configurations and user roles as a code that is subject to robust version control, review processes and audit trails.It optimizes project and user management and corresponds to proven practices in software development and configuration management.

3. AI-controlled service stub generation in the platform
The in-platform AI-controlled service stub generation, which is to be published in the last quarter of 2024, uses KI to automate the initial phases of service development.Users can enter requirements in the management user interface, which causes the AI ​​to generate service stubs that are then pushed into git repositories.This function also contains a tool for creating a sentence of services based on target and expenditure, offers a breakdown of the river and generates the necessary types of events, which accelerates the project introduction and reduces manual coding effort.

4. Event schemes
Event schemes lead a validation level for events based on registered schemes to improve data integrity and consistency across the platform.This function enables an optional scheme assignment to event types and enables the validation of events against predefined structures if there is a scheme.It offers flexibility in maintaining data quality and has platform -wide settings to enforce schemavalidation policies in accordance with project requirements and risk profiles.

5. Integration of pre -installed models
The integration of pre -installed models integrates a generic Large Language Model (LLM) into the platform in order to meet both internal and company -wide requirements.Internally, it supports diagnoses and codegen and improves the platform's self-expectation and developmental skills.For companies, it offers an immediate deployment of AI model for generic tasks and offers advanced AI functionalities without the effort of the development of custom models.This function democratizes access to AI, enables efficient task automation and intelligent decision -making.

6. Expansion of plug-in modules
The expansion of plug-in modules framework introduces EDGE adapter, output adapter and transformer to improve the adaptability and reach of the platform.The transformation modules enable the support of custom service artifact interpreters based on JSON file configurations that are tailored to specific corporate requirements.The development of these plug-in modules is required
