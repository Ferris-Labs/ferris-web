{{< faq question="What are the opportunities, risks and the typical challenges in building an integration platform?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

Opportunities:
(+) Easier and more economical connection formerly separate / redundant areas, systems, processes and data
(+) Faster reaction options to changes
(+) Promotion of balance from flexibility for individual departments and projects with simultaneous standardization of overarching subject areas (semantics, interfaces, security, CI/CD, automation, design approaches, etc.)

Risks:
(-) In the case of isolated and purely technical implementation, risk that redundancy will increase - clear goals with regard to master -slave relationships in data government and in the process view are extremely important.
(-) Conceptual, content-related and procedural integration with the operational hospital operation and the administrative, economic areas are elementary to know and meet the security design and economic expectations

Challenges:
* The governance of an IOP (both in the project and in the company) requires clear responsibilities and high transparency with regard to semantic, linguistic responsibilities and process responsibility.If these have to be created (or strengthened) as part of the implementation project, this must be carried out using concrete use cases and clearly defined areas.
* Synchronization with data governance and the data platform can either lead to strong collaboration or to a competing situation.The responsibilities must be clearly defined in the initialization phase of the project and continuously checked and adequately checked using individual case studies.
