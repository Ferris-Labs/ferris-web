<!-- QUESTION -->

{{< faq question="What functionality does the platform offer in terms of interfaces and integration services?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

Developers basically work in their traditional and familiar environments (IDE).The interfaces of the platform to the IDE are via a protected Git (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) integration.

IDE's can be integrated in the platform or used decentrally.

The base programming language is python.However, the container model enables agnostic use of services written in any other languages.
