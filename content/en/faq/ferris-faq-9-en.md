<!-- ANSWER -->

Training:
As a rule, we assume the training of three targeted user circles.First of all, both architecture and product and platform managers must train in the implementation of integration scenarios with regard to the necessary principles, procedures and design patterns.This training includes self-study and a 4 to 6-hour workshop (presence and/or online).

The integration developers and often also adjacent competencies such as data engineers, data scientists or application developers receive a profound training from the components (a) documentation and self-study, (b) Developer Sandbox (Learning by doing), (c) a presence at 1up to 3 days (depending on the complexity of the desired USZ patterns) and (D) of a coaching phase during the first 3-5 implementations.

The infrastructure managers and platform administrators receive another training path with the developer organization, which focuses on the aspects security, platform deployment & scaling, monitoring & logging, error correction, operation and the provision of new technical components (if required).Here we assume 1-2 days of WS for the DevOps specialists.Appropriate online documentation is also available in this area.
