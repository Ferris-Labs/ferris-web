<!-- ANSWER -->

Event to Event Routing and Transformation is supported:
1) Collecting several events via "Gatekeeper" service, which monitors the criteria for completeness and also manages states and payloads distributed in terms of time.
2) Event mapping, filtering & routing via descriptive code-free, text-based syntax
3) Matching about static assignments, dynamically coded rules or an ML (probabilistic) assignment
