<!-- ANSWER -->

The platform offers a variety of prefabricated integration, database connectors and edge adaptors.

Many of them are based on template and can be duplicated and adapted.Own adaptors and connectors can be added.SAP and ServiceNow are supported as well as Healthtech data formats such as FHIR, HL7V2.5, DICOMWEB and Openehr.

Since all connectors are descriptive (JSON / YAML), all open tour and all propritarian formats can be mapped.
