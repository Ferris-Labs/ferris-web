<!-- ANSWER -->

Each service can freely configure its relevant event types and the associated schemes.Depending on the sequence of the trigger events that occur, dynamic sequences can arise, each of which can be controlled by the event itself, the event state or the event playload.Since each event is in existence and completed, but is brought to coherent event chains via the automated management of correlation IDs, both a continuous audit trail is a granular debugging and direct further use in later projects / use case.
