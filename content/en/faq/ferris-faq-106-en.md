<!-- QUESTION -->

{{< faq question="What roles and permissions can be awarded in the platform?" >}}

<!-- ANSWER -->

The platform supports the separate setup of roles and permissions in the central IAM system.

Roles are specifically created for the areas intended for them.Basically, the IAM differentiates between two types of rollers:
- Realm roles for users and areas
- Client Realm for services and applications

Permits are used to control access to certain resources or actions.Here are some important aspects of authorizations:
- Rol -based access control (RBAC)
- Resource -based access control (RBAC)
- Authorization services
- Integration with identity brokers
- client roles and permissions
- Admin console for the configuration
